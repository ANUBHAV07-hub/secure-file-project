# secure-file-project
User's file security is an essential part when using cloud for storing. This project gives us a method to ensure high security of user's file by encrypting the data inside file and also ensures the secure transfer of keys used by the method of image steganography.
Implementation consists of DES, AES, RC4 and Image Steganography.
DES, AES and RC4 for encrypting and decrypting the text inside the file while image steganography is used for safe transfer of encryption/decryption keys used in the process of hybrid cryptography.
